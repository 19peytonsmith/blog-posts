*On the twenty-fourth inst. of January,* an incident involving a woman and her enraged husband occurred. The man killed his wife by hitting her on the head using a metal bar made of iron and fled the scene. **The former clerk from Gabbari has yet to be discovered.**
The motive for committing this heinous crime is unknown. Perhaps his wife was cheating on him or maybe she cooked him a poor meal. Either way, the suspect is still at large and he needs to be caught before he spreads his mayhem elsewhere.
