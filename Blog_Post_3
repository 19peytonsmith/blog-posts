<p> My serial question is stemming from a series of passages I read in my issue.
There seems to be a massacre of the Jewish population in Russia. I found this
to be interesting because this is decades prior to World War II, where there
was mass homicide of the Jews in Europe. I would like to explore how this built
up throughout the year and what reports are reaching Egypt. They are reporting
mass killings but seem to remain an objective third party.</p>
<p> People tend to say that history has a way of repeating itself. It interests
me that there was mass homicide of the Jewish population 30 years prior to the
most infamous (dare i say successful) murder of millions of Jews. I intend to
explore this topic and the history of conflict Europeans had with the Jewish
population. </p>
