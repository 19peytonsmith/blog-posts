During my journey in IFS2116, I have faced many issues. Some of the issues were easily fixed, some were hard to fix, and some are just plain impossible to fix. My first issue came along the first or second week of class 
when I tried scanning my pages. The computers did not work and then I had to rescan the majority of my page threes.
The journey is long and tedius and very very time consuming. Another issue I faced was the bad quality of image in general. Many of my images
had missing words, blurred words, or a mixture of both. Some of the issues even had missing spots in the paper that left me clueess to what belonged in those spots.
Another technical issue I came across was the ads. A lot of the ads had very tiny bold font that was very difficult to read
and faded as the ad continued down the page. Though their were many difficulties, I do have to say that I learned a great deal from these problems.
These technical issues has led me to believe that nothing is perfect and it is those little imperfections that make the Egyptian Gazette Newspaper so beautiful.
We all must understandd that these pages have been passed on for over 50 years and nothing that old is perfect. The amazing thing is how researchers, like ourselves, go about solving these issues.

If you wish to include a second image (other than your main image, which you indicate in the header), insert a reference in the following format into the body of your post:
