Over the course of this project, i have encountered a couple technical
 difficulties.  Most of them are just because i am not fully educated on the
 subject of markdown, and xml which are not too bad because I learn how to overcome
 them in class.  The one very troubling problem i run into over and over again
 is the ability of the OCR software to correctly recognize the text from the images.
 The software does such a bad job that it takes me roughly 2 hours to correct each page
 of text.  This makes the hardest part of the class busy work, which is not what it
 is meant to be.  I feel that the hard part of the class should be tagging the text
 and learning all of the different tags, what they mean, and how to correctly use them.
 Instead, i am spending most of my time just correcting text.
