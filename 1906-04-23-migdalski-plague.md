In this short newspaper article on the third page of the first day of my issue, the topic was about a plague outbreak that had numerous cases throughout Egypt. Victims of the plague had been reported dead in a number of villages.
The article states some, but not all, of the cases were said to be pneumonic. This creates a curiosity for me. If only the majority of the deaths were caused by pneumonia, I wonder if all of the people who died, were infected by the same disease.  I am also curious if the disease affected different people in different ways. The article explicitly states that they deemed this plague to be contracted through direct contact. I am curious as to the origins of this plague and the characteristics and symptoms of it as well. I searched for outside information regarding this plague and [this website](https://books.google.com/books?id=r_YDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=plague+in+egypt+1906&source=bl&ots=HqzdiEyewX&sig=7Ev85udX7QZKFaTyZEzkBb7ZukY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD79H4pMLSAhXEOSYKHcjnDo4Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q=plague%20in%20egypt%201906&f=false)explains that this plague had affected other countries as well such as India, South America, and Europe.
Additionally, the article talks about improvements made in a village where numerous cases of the plague occurred as well as providing treatment to one infected patient that led to their cure. This proves that the medical professionals of Egypt were able to identify the disease and develop a treatment that helped cure at least one patient. [This website](http://www.ancient.eu/article/51/) explains how diseases were treated in ancient Egypt. They used medicines and "magic" which referred to asking the gods for treatment. I am interested to know how they treated and cured the single patient.
As I continue to go through my week in this newspaper, I hope to find more information about this plague. I wonder if the number of deaths will decreases and if a fully effective cure is developed to prevent further infections.
