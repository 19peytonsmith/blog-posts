# Impact from Climate in Alexandria

The climate in Alexandria, Egypt has always been unconditionally hot.
The **Egyptian Gazette** refers the summer months The dry heat gives the
residents no relief, even at night.
Even though Alexandria is close to the Nile River,
the western desert provides much of that dry heat to Alexandria.
Many citizens escape the heat by going to somewhere cooler in Europe.
We may ask ourselves now, was the temperature a factor in activities in Egypt?
An day described as an average spring day in Alexandria hit a temperature of
29 degrees celcius (84* Farenheit).The *Daily Weather Report* from the
**Egyptian Gazette** highlights the different observed temperatures and
conditions throughout different locations around Egypt. The graph shows
recorded conditions around Alexandria. The *Daily Weather Report* also records
 the moon phases and other station's conditions. All these values are published
in the Egyptian Gazette once or twice a week.
I searched through working sets and got the query-
 //table[@xml:id="AlexandriaWeather"]/row[contains(.,'Max')]/cell[3]/measure
to get 1905 daily max. temperatures from Alexandria's observations.![Max.
temperatures from  1905].
Then I did the query //table[@xml:id="deg-ta-dawr01"]/row[contains(.,'Max')]/cell[3]/measure/text()
to get the data from 1906 and 1907, since it used a different template.

conditions.The coldest temperature is even higher than the average temperature
for Earth (57*). Alexandria's average temperature mean of 25.81* Celcius or
78.5 degrees Farenheit.These temperatures demonstrate that the climate was
much warmer for many other livable places in the world.

  The seasons in Egypt are quite minimal. It is hot all year around,
and many people escaped the heat in the summer.
Especially the British who were not used to the heat,
since the UK has a maritime climate.
Winter and summer align with the U.S., since Alexandria is in the northern
hemisphere.

The results I received from my data can be conclusive. The average temperature
was 25.81*, while the High and Low temperatures were 39* and 10.5*. This means
that the temperatures were 102.2* and 50.9* in Farenheit, giving the average to
be. A few data points were taken out of the graph due to being outliers.
The first outlying point was a mistake in the *Egyptian Gazette*. The printed
high temperature in the shade displayed on the issue from March 5th 1906, said
it was 7.5*. This can only be a mistake considering below it says the low
 temperature was 11.3*. Therefore the point was taken out. seventy-six other
 values were also extracted due to the inaccuracy of duplicating the template.
