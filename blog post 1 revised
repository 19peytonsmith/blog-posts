Something that has caught my eye while reading these articles from March 1905 to April 1905
is that on the first issue on the third day, there is a small article about a man by the name of Maxim Gorki.
It says he is to be prosecuted because charges have been given to him that he drafted proclamations aiming to
overthrow the existing state of the Empire. It also says his health has broken down and that he is liable to
three years of detention in a fortress. It also then gives the day of the trial. Gorki is said to be in a place called Riga
and is under surveillance. I find this curious because I would like to know more information on this matter.
I would also like to know how the trial ended up. I also find it curious because it is such a small article about
this man's prosecution. I would think it would be longer. I would also like to know about the place, Riga, that he is in
and if he is such a dangerous criminal that he has to be under surveillance.

If you wish to include a second image (other than your main image, which you indicate in the header), insert a reference in the following format into the body of your post:
