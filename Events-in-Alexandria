One of the most important aspects of culture is the method in which people who share this culture are united. This method of uniting people can be either through language, like in Germany where the dialects are of the utmost importance, or through sports like the Myan civilizations. I intend to determine the most common event listed in the calendar of events throughout the year of the news paper, in an attempt to gain insight into that which united the people of Alexandria, Egypt even though they were of varying social class and nationality. While the answer to "what united the people of Alexandria" may be much harder to answer than that which can be found via a simple search of one year of a news paper, simply determining which events occurred most often could provide a useful beginning to developing the whole of the answer to that much larger question.
