#The Bubonic Plague has Arrived
##Striking Now in Egypt
###Spread by Rats and Fleas
The Bubonic Plague has been striking Egypt,
including Alexandria. Many people have come
down with the disease, and many have been
admitted to hospitals. Deaths have also been
associated with this deadly disease.
The disease has turned into an epidemic since
it once again arose from the depths of ancient
times. [For Information about the Ancient Plagues Visit!]
(https://www.cdc.gov/plague/history/)
This new plague, still spread from rats and rat
fleas, has taken over all parts of the world.
Unfortunately, it has reached Egypt and Alexandria
and has no signs of stopping anytime soon. Death
rates are high for the disease, and in some
cities without hospitals many people are at
risk. People should stay away from many of the
rats infecting cities, because who knows where the
rats are transmitting the disease from. Many people
die each day as reported in the newspapers, and more
are being committed into hospitals at the same time.
Many hope that the death rates of the plague decrease
over time, but for many people whose family members'
have already been infected have little hope for the
future. Some talk about vaccines and ways to stop
the disease, but we have not received any of it yet
because people are still dying.
