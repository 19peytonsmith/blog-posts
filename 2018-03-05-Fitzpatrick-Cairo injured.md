For the blog post I chose an article titled “Cairo Visitor Gravely Injured”
 from page 3 of the Thursday December 1906 issue. The article talks about an
  accident that occurred on the P. and O. express the Friday before where two
   passengers were injured, and I believe one of them died? Its not very clear
    and is not actually stated but, is implied.
The two passengers injured were Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hanns, who were visiting
 from Dublin. Mrs. Hanns was not seriously injured but it seems that Mr. Hanns
  was killed. The suspected death was caused by a piece of metal that crashed
  through the window. Apparently, they’re not sure how it really happened,
  either from a bridge or a part of the train which doesn’t really make sense
  because I would think if it came from the bridge it would cause more external
   damage versus internal like the part of the train would cause making it
   easier to pinpoint the cause.
This leads me to question just how in-depth incidents were investigated in
 Egypt at this time. Did they just quickly glance at the scene and decide on
 the circumstances surrounding it, or did they thoroughly investigate and try
 to find the actual cause. Hopefully Mr. Hanns isn’t turning in this grave as
  I type this, knowing that the true cause of his death will remain unknown.
