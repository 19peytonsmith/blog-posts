6. Send a pull request to the group repository
1. Fork the repository
Fork a copy of the organization blog-posts repository on your personal github
account. Do this by clicking on the “fork” icon on the top right. You will be
offered the chance to fork the repository under your own username–do so. This
 will make a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, in which you
 should save your draft blog posts.

2. Name your post
Paste this default text into a text editor (such as Atom) and save it with a
unique name following this format: 2016-09-01-yourlastname-post-name.md. Plug
 in today’s date and a distinctive name for your post.

3. Fill in the header
The header (the material in the opening lines of the document, between the
two — lines) is very important. It tells the website how to treat your blog
 post. Enter your name (in quotation marks) as the subheadline. Give your post
 a title and provide a one to two sentence teaser. Enter the date and your name.
  Use the category “curiosities” for post 1, “technical” for post 2, and
   “serial questions” for post 3. List a few tags that reflect the subject
    matter that your post covers. Enter the name of an image that you would
    like to appear to promote the post on the header, thumb, and homepage lines,
     and give that image a caption and (if appropriate) a link. (For more on
      images, see number 5 below.)

4. Write a post in markdown and add images
You will write your text using Markdown, a very simple markup language but a
 different one from xml, which you are using for the newspaper pages. Here’s a
 tutorial and here’s a cheatsheet. Aim for at least 200 words, but it’s fine if
  you write more. Integrate some links into your post, and use an image or two.

5. Working with images
Include an image clipped from your issue of the paper, and any other images that
 might add to the impact of your post. If you are using an image that you find
  on the internet, make sure that you have the right to reuse it, and download
   the image (don’t just link to it). To include images in your post, add a
    line in the following format: ![Image label](image-file-name.png). Save
    these images in the forked folder. Make sure that you give all of the
     images a distinctive name, and use that name in the header and body.

6. Send a pull request to the group repository
When your blog post and image are ready, you can fold them back into the
organization content repository by sending me a pull request. You do this by
 clicking the “new pull request” button the top left above your list of files.
  I will then see the pull request and either merge your files into the
   organization’s content or request that you change something before doing so.

   Often in the Egyptian Gazette fire is mentioned as having caused the death of a resident or the destruction of significant property. On January 4th, 1907 for example, the Gazette reports a large fire on a gunwharf that caused thousands of pounds of goods to be destroyed, officially estimated at a current value of 250,000 British pounds.
   Another instance of the debilitating effects of fire mentioned in the Gazette was on January 10, 1905. This fire broke out on Tousson Street in Alexandria, at a store filled with chandeliers, lamps, and large amounts of petroleum. Although a fire engine was on scene 5 minutes after the alarm was activated, eight hoses continuously dumping water could not stop the fire for two hours.
   These announcements had vital potential impact on the citizens of Alexandria to raise awareness of the absolute devastation fire could cause and the necessity for precautions against such a danger. The Gazette's report of fire damage from around the world served the purpose of bringing a more thorough knowledge of the universal issue of uncontrolled fires to the people of Alexandria.

   Because the fire fighting techniques of the day were not entirely effective, as realized in the above example, the explicit, long term, and life threatening effects of fire were a necessary understanding among the people of Alexandria in those years, and the Gazette provided consistent documentation to serve that purpose.
