[Egyptology](https://www.britannica.com/science/Egyptology) has caputured pop-culture imagination owing to movies like _The Mummy_, and exhibits like King Tut.  Films often emphasize the mysticism, magic, or exoticism of Egyptian artefacts and Tombs.  The Egyptian Gazette, however, provides a closer perspective, both in time and location.

While the excavation and discovery of these tombs has historical significance on a global scale, the local perspective brings the actual characters that advanced the discovery of these relics to light.  The [newspaper](https://github.com/Lionex/dig-eg-gaz/blob/7dbde112756552ed412ee7145eb84208ffe34fd4/ocr/1905-10-06-p3.txt#L88) serves as a medium for criticism and discourse, which time and distance have buried.

This liveliness caught me off guard, and reminds me that the study of history always lives and breaths, not confined to memory or buried between the covers of a textbook.

The newspaper discusses a work by Dr. Petrie, _[A History of Egypt during the XVIIth and XVIIIth Dynasties](https://archive.org/details/cu31924085360844)_, offering a condensed review of the material, and harsh criticism of Dr. Petrie's commentary on the work of other archaeologists.

This commentary reveals some valuable context behind the study of history, as well as the history itself, and brings to life the real characters behind the study of Egyptology that we often romanticize in pop culture.
