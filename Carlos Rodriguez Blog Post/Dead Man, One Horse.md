Murders overall aren’t that common, so it was even more surprising when I found out that there was a murderous horse on the lose! On July 7, 1906, it was reported that a man sneaked into the yard of a resident, even though his intentions were never discovered it is assumed by the article that his sole goal was to steal a horse. When in the process of untying the ropes of the animal, the horse kicked him square in the face, killing him instantly. This is one thief that never got a second chance. It makes me wonder if there are any other murders animals in Alexandria, other than the everyday man. If it wasn’t for the horse killing him I believe the owner would have killed him if caught. I came to this conclusion after reading many articles having to do with thief’s and criminals. Even if it wasn’t the owner the police would have surely caught him because according to the newspaper they have an excellent arrest rate. Yet the fate of this poor man was surely set the minute he decided to trespass someone’s property. Upon reading this I am almost certain that thieves all over the city were either scared of stealing anymore horse, or that they were just more careful when stealing.
