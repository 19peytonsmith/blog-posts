The blog describes an interesting story about a couple. They were having trouble with eachother and were in a huge argument.
The husband attempted to throw the wife out the window but he was unable to do some. In the end the couple both fell out of the window.
It was a very interesting news article to read and I thought it was evily humorous how in the end both people fell out of the window.
