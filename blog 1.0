<p>There were some mysterious deaths happening on December 4th, 1905. One of the more interesting ones that I have found on page 3, of the “Egyptian Gazette” copy, was of a suicide. It read that a Dr. John Sierra “was in the best of health on Saturday and he spent a portion of the day in settling his private affairs and making preparations for his death”. It then goes on to say that he committed suicide that night by “opening and artery”. Events like this are the reason why life insurances have suicide clauses. A suicide clause is enacted in most life insurance policies. For example, in Colorado the life insurance must be in force for a year before a suicide will be covered. In other States the clause is over 2 years. Another death occured Saturday when, Owadalla Eff. Aryan was getting off of a train before it had fully come to a stop. He then fell underneath the carriages and was “terribly mutilated”. Another death that proves why we have certain laws and rules. Thank you 1905 Egypt. </p>
