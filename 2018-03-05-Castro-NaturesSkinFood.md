On my Tuesday issue, I found an interesting home remedy for acne and other skin problems. It appears this is something distinct and special to Alexandria. As I was adding the advertisement for page 2 of the October 1906 issue. As a person that loves to learn about skin care and is addicted to by skin care products, this advertisement stood out to me. According to the advertisement, the cream derives from Icilma Natural Water, but most have named it Nature's Skin Food. From the Icilma Natural water a cream is produced called the Icilma Flour Cream. It is described as the being a no grease or oil cream which I find amazing because most skin care products are filled with oil that, as a result, often causes the skin to produce more oil. This is especially helpful to people that have oily skin which leads them to have problematic skin. The advertisement states that it cleanses the pores of the skin and make it pearly white. I think the Icilma Flour Cream could possibly have been the modern invention of acne remedies in Alexandria during the 1900s. The Icilma Flour Cream sounds like the Neutrogena or Proactive most people preferred to use for their skin problems.
