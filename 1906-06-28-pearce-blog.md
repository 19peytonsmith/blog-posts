In the Egyptian Gazette, the third or fourth pages always begin to get deep into the local news, including stories of crimes, births, deaths, and all sorts of events. This particular issue occurred on a Thursday, and prior to this Thursday the different information unfolding from a criminal trial based in the Denishwai village inside of Chibin el Kom. A bad attack occurred between rebels and officers of the Egyptian police force.  “AS the crowd prevented the Major and his two comrades from getting into carriages, pulled them about and beat them, throwing bricks and dry mud at them...” I like this statement from the Egyptian Gazette, as I think of it as a simile to the present-day life of a student in some ways. As a student myself, being overwhelmed with homework, exams, quizzes can really seem as if I was getting metaphorically beaten, having bricks and dry mud thrown at you. Of course, nobody should have to know the brutal beatings that Captain Bull, Lieutenant Smithwick, and Major Pine-Coffin, along with other innocent people had faced in this attack. All in all, this has been the most enjoyable part of the story of the attack at Denishwai, as it used some very descriptive language, making it as easy as possible to see the brutal beatings that occurred on that day in 1906.
