Unfortunately, my technical reflection is primarily negative. When the class first began I found that scanning my pages and using OCR went pretty smoothly besides the fact that many of the words were not recognized. In most cases I had to retype full paragraphs for the newspaper to make sense. When the XML editor was first introduced to me I was very lost and overwhelmed. I had no idea what XML meant or how it was supposed to change the text. However, with some assistance I have become more adept at placing structural tags and finding errors in my text. TEI-tagged XML text was also a struggle for me. I did not understand exactly how to use it and I was only able to tag two historical figures. I had never heard of the website Github until taking this class and I am still a little unsure what it is exactly used for. Again, with some practice I quickly became comfortable using it to submit the work I have completed. The final challenge I have faced are blog posts, in which I have trouble converting into Markdown and using the correct format.
