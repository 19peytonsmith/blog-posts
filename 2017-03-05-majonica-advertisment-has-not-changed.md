I happen to really enjoy encoding "The Egyptian Gazette," it is almost therapeutic. As I venture into another day of my week in Alexandria during January 1907, I am becoming accustomed with this format, easily pulling code from other parts of the paper I, and my classmates, have already worked on.
My favorite part of the paper is the advertisement section. No hassle of OCR, lots of pictures, and its sheer simplicity makes me feel like an encoding wiz. And when I was working on my Thursday issue, I imagined myself reading this paper in Alexandria. This was surprisingly simple to me, as I began to memorize the advertisements in the same way they probably did, knowing their location and contents by heart. How different is this from the advertisements we come into contact with today? The same tactics are used, especially in the advertisements for medicine, except the medium in which they are received has changed. [Although their contents may have shifted](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/the-evolution-of-cigarette-advertising/), people are still consumed with [products that provide personal benefits](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/nunez-blogpost/), vacations, and schedules it seems, because now as commercials, computer and phone advertisements are everywhere things were not very different in Egypt at this time and in "The Egyptian Gazette." And in Alexandria it seems that just like in 2018, trying to get the daily news comes with an unexpected bombardment of advertisements that we love to hate, but hate to love.
