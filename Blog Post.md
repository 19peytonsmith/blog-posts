On October 16, 1906 there have been multiple reports if incidents of the bubonic order to meet the demand for a feed to
deal satisfactorily with materials such as sugar ,corn, rice, small coal, and similar materials, which do not clog or stick in serrations or pocket of feeds, the Hardy Patent Pick Company, of Sheffield, have introduced a patent.
This consists of a revolving internal drum or barrel, having conical pockets round periphery of drum from edge to edge, and arranged in a spiral or worm form. The material is fed into a hopper, which is fixed to the top of the feed
dram ; the revolving action of the dram carries the material, which is deposited in the pockets, to the discharge opening—fitted at the bottom of the drum box,—and this discharges it into the mouth of the grinding machine is a steady and continuous, thereby considerably increasing the output of the grinding mill. We strongly recommend intending purchasers of grinding machines to adopt the above feed, the results obtained, both in quality and output of material, being extremely satisfactory. Plague and Typhoid Fever. Citizens are dying at an alarming rate and there has reportedly been an outbreak on a steamship that was set to sail to Ras-el-Tin. A first class domestic man by the name of R. Cole sailing on H.M.S Venus was suffering from symptoms of "interior fever" and was rushed to the hospital immediately after disembarking the ship. Mr. Cole tragically succumbed to his illness at 2.45am on October 16.
A second case of typhoid fever occurred on board the Venus since her arrival of Egyptian waters. The first person to experience symptoms was Captain Eyre, who has since been rushed to a hospital in Port Said.
The week prior to October 15, there have been a report of 6 cases of the Bubonic Plague throughout the country of Egypt,  3  cases at Alexandria, 2 at Suez, and one in the Minieh district. This is alarming as 492 cases have been reported since the start of the year, and this is a large increase from the previous year of 1905 where 264 incidents had been reported.

The bubonic plague has been reported many times before by my peers throughout their issues, which demonstrates to me that the bubonic plague was a common occurrence throughout this era. My peers often discuss the plague in Egypt, however "the Plague" taking many lives as modern medicine was not readily available for everyone during this time. The Typhoid Fever however was not a disease that occurred often, which is why throughout my issue, people were fearful that the disease would spread.
